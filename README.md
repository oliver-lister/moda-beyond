## Setup

### Run Frontend Locally using the Render-hosted Backend

Unfortunately you <b>cannot</b> run the backend locally at full functionality without the keys and secrets in my backend's .env file which is ignored by git.

To avoid problems, I recommend running the frontend in production mode via the below commands:

    cd frontend // change directory into frontend folder
    npm install // install dependencies
    npm run build // run build
    npx vite preview // expose the build on a localhost port for viewing

This will connect your frontend running on your localhost server with the backend hosted by <a href="https://render.com/">render</a>.

_Note: The frontend is currently pointed to a backend hosted by <a href="https://render.com/">render</a> on a free instance. This means it will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more. Please allow a minute for the backend to warmup on start-up before testing any functionality._

### Admin (Custom CMS)

The same situation presents itself with the admin frontend, again please run it in production mode via the below commands

    cd admin // change directory into frontend folder
    npm install // install dependencies
    npm run build // run build
    npx vite preview // expose the build on a localhost port for viewing
