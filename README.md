### Run Frontend Locally using the Render-hosted Backend

Unfortunately you <b>cannot</b> run the backend locally at full functionality without the keys and secrets in my backend's .env file which is ignored by git.

To avoid problems, I recommend running the frontend in production mode by:

1. Changing directory into frontend folder.
2. Installing dependencies
3. Running build command
4. Exposing the build on a localhost port for viewing.

<!-- end of the list -->

    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run build
    npx vite preview

This will connect your frontend running on your localhost server with the backend hosted by <a href="https://render.com/">render</a>.

_Note: The frontend is currently pointed to a backend hosted by <a href="https://render.com/">render</a> on a free instance. This means it will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more. Please allow a minute for the backend to warmup on start-up before testing any functionality._

### Admin (Custom CMS)

The same situation presents itself with the admin frontend, again please run it in production mode via the below commands:

    cd admin
    npm install
    npm run build
    npx vite preview

This project orginated from a tutorial from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev">GreatStack</a> on YouTube called:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y99YgaQjgx4">How To Create Full Stack E-Commerce Website Using React JS, MongoDB, Express & Node JS 2024</a>. Once reviewing and implementing GreatStack's build, I diverged on my own project to create a more efficient, detailed and better looking product:

- I also decided to build the entire project in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, which I had never used prior.
- I used the <a href="https://mantine.dev/">MantineCSS</a> component library for the first time, which after doing research I found it paired well with CSS modules.
- Instead of using React's <a href="https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context">Context API</a>, I learned and used <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux Tookit</a> for global state management. This also involved learning Async Thunks.
- In the Frontend, I created more comprehensive account routes for accessing user data, and impressive cart and payment functionality.
- In the Backend, I created a more complex authenication process which allowed for database sessions and refresh tokens.
- I also found GreatStack, occasionaly strayed from best design and code practices and took some shortcuts which would lead to scalabilities issues down the line.

For products, I used content, and images from <a href="https://www.theiconic.com.au/">TheICONIC</a>. TheICONIC also was a key design inspiration for a lot of the website, e.g. NavBar and ProductDisplay component. I also took some inspiration from the way <a href="https://www.catch.com.au/">Catch.com.au</a> designed their Cart. For banner images, I used <a href="https://unsplash.com/">UnSplash</a>.
